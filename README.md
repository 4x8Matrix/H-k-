# Hōkū
Hōkū _(Hawaiian for "star")_ is a VR Overlay engine designed to empower Luau developers to create custom OpenVR overlays with ease. By reducing the complexity traditionally associated with OpenVR development, Hōkū aims to lower the barrier to entry and enable developers to craft innovative VR overlays.

#### Project Goals
Hōkū is built with the following objectives in mind:

- **2D Overlay Testing:**
  - Implement support for testing OpenVR overlays in a 2D window for quick iteration and debugging.
- **OpenGL Integration:**
  - Provide seamless OpenGL support to harness high-performance graphics rendering.
- **OpenVR Overlay Support:**
  - Build robust support for OpenVR overlays to ensure compatibility with SteamVR and similar systems.
- **Luau-Driven Development:**
  - Write the majority of the project's codebase in Luau, promoting high-level scripting in a traditionally low-level environment.

#### Motivation
This project allows me to:

- Deepen my understanding of technologies like OpenVR and OpenGL.
- Experiment with overlay development in an approachable way.
- Realize a personal dream of creating my own VR overlay.

#### Getting Started
Stay tuned for setup instructions, examples, and documentation to help you get started with Hōkū.
